            <p>
              Founded in 2025, SocialConnections was born out of a simple observation: despite being more connected digitally than ever before, people are feeling increasingly isolated and lonely.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our platform was created by a team of passionate developers and social scientists who recognized that current social media prioritizes viral content over genuine human connection.
            </p>
            <p>
              We set out to build something different - a platform that helps people form meaningful, interest-based relationships that extend beyond the digital realm into real-world connections.
